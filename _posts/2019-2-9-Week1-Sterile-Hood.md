title: Week #1 Sterile Hood

My sterile hood design is based on BioHack Academy's design below.

- 1/4 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft. PureBond Birch Plywood [Homedepot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Columbia-Forest-Products-1-4-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-PureBond-Birch-Plywood-165891/100092485)
- Ikea range hood LUFTIG (190CFM) [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20222533/)
- Filtrete True HEPA Air Purifier Filter [Lowes](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Filtrete-True-HEPA-Air-Purifier-Filter/1000772692)
- 8 ft. 16/2 Power Tool Replacement Cord
- Phillips Pan-Head Machine Screws, Hex Nuts, and washer (M5 and M3)

Ikea range hood I was able to buy from my local ikea was LUFTIG and the fan motor was screwed on the main structure of hood. So I have to took it out. Also the largest HEPA filter that was available in my local hardware store was size D (345 x 300 x 36mm). So I designed my sterile hood based on mainly these two factors. I used wood glue for all of the plywood panels except the top/cover panel. It's held by M3 screws so that I could access inside. For finishing, Clear Shellac coat was sprayed and I sanded it with 400 grit sand papers.
