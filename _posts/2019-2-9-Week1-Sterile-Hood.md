title: Week1 Sterile Hood
---

My sterile hood design is based on BioHack Academy's design below.
<https://github.com/biohackacademy/BHA_SterileHood>

But Ikea range hood I was able to buy from my local ikea was [LUFTIG (Vented extractor fan, $49.00](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20222533/).<BR>
The fan was screwed on the main structure of hood. So I took it out.
