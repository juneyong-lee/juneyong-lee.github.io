Materials
- Nutrient Agar (Ager 65.2%, Peptones 21.7%, Beef Extract 13%) [Carolina Biological Supply Company](https://www.carolina.com/dehydrated-media/nutrient-agar-dehydrated-medium-100-g/785300.pr?question=785300)
- Distilled Water
- Petri Dish

Finally my contamination test is done. I followed [this instruction](http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha6/class/2/contamination-test/).

I mixed 4.6g of Nutrient Agar with 200ml of distilled water and then autoclaved in a pressure cooker for more than 20 min. Maybe I purchased too big size pressure cooker/canner, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QJJ9NY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It took more than an hour to get to the about 10 psi even though I intended to bring it up to 15 psi. 

I left one petri dish on top of my work area for 30 min cover open and another one inside of running [sterile hood.](https://juneyong-lee.github.io/Week1-Sterile-Hood/)

Itâ€™s successful that the sterile hood one came out clean and work area one had two molds.
